- Layout and Design

Accurate color scheme âœ…
Font styles and sizes âœ…
Element positioning and spacing âœ…
Consistent theming across UI components âœ…

- Interactive Investment Calculator

Increment the investment amount by $10,000, unless it is below or equal to $10,000, in which case it should
increment or decrement by $1,000 until it reaches the minimum of $250. âœ…
Implement exponential incrementation when the plus or minus button is held down. âœ…
Include a user experience (UX) element indicating that the button can be held (e.g., a visual cue and/or   haptic feedback). âœ…
all calculations are performed accurately and displayed dynamically âœ…

- Data Handling: Integrate a mock data service to simulate fetching and updating bond information âœ…

- Code Organization: Write clean, modular code with clear naming conventions and proper comments, adhering to  Dart/Flutter best practices. âœ…

- Interactive Animations: Create smooth and responsive animations that activate during user interactions with the calculator and the list of bonds.  âœ…

- State Management: Utilize a bloc state management solution to manage the state of the application efficiently. âœ…

- Custom Theme: Develop a custom Flutter theme to apply across the app for styling consistency. âœ…

- Responsive Design: Make sure the page is responsive and renders well on different device sizes and orientations.âœ…

- Networking: Simulate API calls with loading indicators when the investment data is 'fetched' or 'updated'.âœ…

- Documentation: Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project, including any necessary commands or dependencies. ðŸ˜Š
- Snap Page Scrolling: 

Implement snap scrolling to allow users to navigate through different sections of the Home Screen seamlessly.âœ…
Each scroll 'snap' should correspond to a discrete section of the page for focused user engagement.âœ…

- Dynamic Card Updates:

Cards displaying information should have a mechanism to update content dynamically.âœ…
Upon update, cards should briefly flash with a semi-transparent overlay, signaling content change to the user without being intrusive.âœ…
Swipeable Interface:
Enable horizontal swiping to navigate through different pages or tabs of the Home Screen.âœ…
Ensure smooth transition animations between pages to enhance user interaction.âœ…

- Integration Tab Navigation:

Implement a tab labeled 'Integration' that, when tapped, transitions the user to the 'Fixed Income' page with a fluid animation.âœ…
This navigation should simulate a real-life application flow where different financial products are interconnected.âœ…

- Global Animations:

Incorporate subtle animations throughout the Home Screen that activate upon user interactions such as tapping, scrolling, or swiping.âœ…
Animations should be consistent with the design language and enhance the user experience without overwhelming the content.âœ…
